# Your turn

We are going to play a game of "Stump the Professor". Flip a coin. If it shows up tails do A first, if it shows up heads to B first. 

  `A. Write down a sequence of heads and tails that you might expect to come from TWENTY flips of a coin`
  
  `B. Now flip a coin TWENTY times, and write down the outcomes`
- Enter these in the [online sheet](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/155fP-mdd0HevqNYEVUngEBVWHXmxYi-B5zPzKjikEb0/edit) (Remember whether you entered the coin flip sequence first or the made up sequence.)
- Now I am going to look at what you entered, and guess if sequence was made up, or actual outcomes from coin flips. 
- You record how many times I get it right.

# Example: a look at the Australian electoral distribution

- Results of 2013 election from Australian Electoral Commission web site
- 2011 Census data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics
- Combined demographics of electorate with political representation
- Interactive application, in R package `eechidna`

# How to use randomization to understand probability

# Your turn

- What is the difference (roughly) in population between the biggest and smallest electorates?
- What is the relative worth of a voter in the electorate with the largest population, compared to a voter in the electorate with the smallest population?

---
# Politics

- Ideally all electorates have exactly the same number of people.
- Geography can interfere with this, e.g an electorate cannot be part in Tasmania and part in Victoria.
- The Australian Electoral Commission will adjust geographic boundaries before each election to adjust for population changes as measured in the most recent Census.

# Compute averages


```
#&gt; # A tibble: 2 x 3
#&gt;     PartyGp      m     s
#&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
#&gt; 1       ALP 149245 20167
#&gt; 2 Coalition 139537 12337
```

# Statistical thinking

- The means are different
- How big is this difference?
- How likely is this difference to have arisen by chance?

We could use a two-sample t-test to answer these, but here is how to do the equivalent by randomization.

---
# Procedure

- Compute the statistic for the data (e.g. absolute value of mean difference)
- Shuffle the group labels (e.g. put the MP party names into a hat, mix them around, draw them and assign to new electorate)
- Compute the statistic for this shuffled data
- Repeat steps 2, 3 many times
- Examine how often the value of the data statistic, or a larger value occurs

---
# Let's do it

&lt;img src="week1.class1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Let's also count the number of times that we see a bigger difference by chance. It is 0. 

---
# What does this mean?

If we oberve a difference this large 0 out of 1000 random shuffles, is it likely to see this electorate distribution by chance?

---
# Caveats

Let's wait until the next Census results are in (after August this year) and the latest election results, to compare populations of electorates again. 

---
# Next steps

- Next few classes we will 
    - review statistical hypothesis testing
    - go through a few more examples of using permutation to make statistical significance tests
    - discuss random number generators, and simulating events
    - compute probabilities of events, and 
- Lab this week will be getting started with using R - the top data science software available today.

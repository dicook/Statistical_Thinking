# Overview 

- Decision Theory is concerned with the mathematical analysis of decision making when the __state of the world is uncertain__ but information can be obtained about it by means of observation or experimentation.
- Some __action must be chosen__ from a well defined set of alternatives, but the exact circumstances in which the action must be taken are unknown.
- Different actions implies different consequences and therefore have different merit according to the decision maker's preference.

---
# Overview

- Assuming that __some numerical value__ can be assigned to the different combinations of circumstances and actions provides a basis for assessing __how reasonable a particular action is in different situations__.
- It may be possible to obtain __data__ that will yield information about the prevailing circumstances, or prior information concerning the __frequency with which different circumstances arise__.
- The aim of __decision theory__ is to provide a means of exploiting such information to determine a __reasonable__ (optimal?) __course of action__.

# Rock, paper, scissors

Strategy      | Decision   | Rock | Paper | Scissors
-----|-----|-----|-----|-----
`\(a_1\)` | Rock | 0 |  -1 | 1
`\(a_2\)` | Paper | 1 | 0 | -1
`\(a_3\)` | Scissors | -1 | 1 | 0

Your choices are `\(a_1, a_2, a_3\)`. Depending on what the opponent chooses you win (1), lose (-1) or tie (0). __What should you choose?__

---
# Decision under ignorance/risk

- Decision under __ignorance__: probability of the possible outcomes __unknown or does not exist__
- Decision under __risk__: __probability__ of the possible outcomes __known__
- Decision under uncertainty: synonym for ignorance, or as a broader term referring to both risk and ignorance

What is rock, paper, scissors?

- Decision under risk?
- Decision under ignorance?

# Zero-sum two person games

- The payoff is the amount of money each player receives after choosing their respective strategies 
- Whatever one player loses, the other player wins.
- Each player must choose his own strategy without knowing what his opponent is going to do.
- An objective is to determine optimal winning strategies.

# Rock, paper, scissors

Strategy      | Decision  | Rock (1/3) | Paper  (1/3) | Scissors (1/3) 
----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | -----
`\(a_1\)` | Rock | 0 |  -1 | 1
`\(a_2\)` | Paper | 1 | 0 | -1
`\(a_3\)` | Scissors | -1 | 1 | 0

Whatever you choose you have a 1/3 of winning, losing or tieing.

# Let's simulate the game

- Fix your decision to be `\(a_1\)`, without loss of generality
- Randomly generate the opponents response
- Count the number of times you win, lose, tie

Run 1:


```
#&gt; d
#&gt;    Paper     Rock Scissors 
#&gt;     3236     3419     3345
```

Run 2:


```
#&gt; d
#&gt;    Paper     Rock Scissors 
#&gt;     3370     3324     3306
```

Run 3:


```
#&gt; d
#&gt;    Paper     Rock Scissors 
#&gt;     3364     3357     3279
```

There is no optimal strategy.

# Different probabilities

Strategy      | Decision  | Rock (0.354) | Paper  (0.350) | Scissors (0.296) 
----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | -----
`\(a_1\)` | Rock | 0 |  -1 | 1
`\(a_2\)` | Paper | 1 | 0 | -1
`\(a_3\)` | Scissors | -1 | 1 | 0

Check that the probabilities sum to 1. (Why?) Now what should be your strategy?

(Probabilities reported in article in [http://www.telegraph.co.uk](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11051704/How-to-always-win-at-rock-paper-scissors.html))

# Your turn

If your strategy is 

- `\(a_1\)`, 
- `\(a_2\)`, or
- `\(a_3\)`,

your chance of winning should be?

# Let's simulate it

- Generate `\(n\)` samples from a `uniform(0,1)` distribution
- Bin the number into `0-0.354, 0.354-0.654, 0.654-1` to match the probabilities of opponent choices
- Count the proportion of `\(n\)` times you would win under each strategy `\(a_1, a_2, a_3\)`.

For each of the following runs, my `\(n=10000\)`.

Your strategy is `\(a_1\)`, `Rock`:


```
#&gt; [1] 0.35
```

Your strategy is `\(a_2\)`, `Paper`:


```
#&gt; [1] 0.36
```

Your strategy is `\(a_3\)`, `Scissors`:


```
#&gt; [1] 0.3
```

# Pay off matrix, includes opp payoff

Strategy      | Decision  | Rock (0.354) | Paper  (0.350) | Scissors (0.296) 
----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | -----
`\(a_1\)` | Rock | 0, 0 |  -1, 1 | 1, -1
`\(a_2\)` | Paper | 1, -1 | 0, 0 | -1, 1
`\(a_3\)` | Scissors | -1, 1 | 1, -1 | 0, 0

$$\mbox{payoff}|a_1 = 0\times 0.354 - 1\times0.350 + 1\times 0.296 = -0.054 $$
$$\mbox{payoff}|a_2 =  1\times 0.354 + 0\times0.350 - 1\times 0.296 = 0.058 $$

`$$\mbox{payoff}|a_3 =  -1\times 0.354 + 1\times0.350 + 0\times 0.296 = -0.004$$`

There's a clear winner!

# Your turn

Under a different payoff?

Strategy      | Decision  | Rock (0.354) | Paper  (0.350) | Scissors (0.296) 
----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | -----
`\(a_1\)` | Rock | 0, 0 |  -1, 1 | 1, -1
`\(a_2\)` | Paper | 2, -1 | -1, 0 | -1, 1
`\(a_3\)` | Scissors | -1, 1 | 1, -1 | 0, 0

- Is it still a zero sum game?
- What is the expected payoff under each strategy?

# Taxonomy of games

- Zero-sum versus nonzero-sum games
- Non-cooperative versus cooperative games
- Simultaneous-move versus sequential-move games
- Games with perfect information versus games with imperfect information
- Non-symmetric versus symmetric games 
- Two-person versus n-person games 
- Non-iterated versus iterated games

# Decision theory model

- There is a well defined set of possible actions, a, that constitutes an action space `\(A\)`.
- The state of the world, or state of nature, is represented by a parameter `\(\theta\)`. The set of possible states of nature, the state space (or parameter space) `\(\theta\)`, is known.
- There is a loss function `\(l(a, \theta)\)` defined on the space of consequences `\(A \times \theta\)` which assigns a value to the loss incurred if action a is taken when the prevailing state of nature is `\(\theta\)`.
-  Data ($x$) from a random experiment with sample space `\(\Omega\)` is available that provides information on the possible state of nature that prevails.

Examples of decision problems: hypothesis testing, parameter estimation, games, etc.

#  The Decision Theory Model as a 2-person game

- Analogy with a zero sum two person game?
- The decision maker (the scientist or statistician, say) and nature replace the two players,
- The payoff is replaced by the corresponding loss (the loss function is assumed to be given).
- The data may be thought of as a form of “spying”. The aim is to select the best action with respect to the loss function having regard to the extent and basis of any information that is available concerning the prevailing state of nature.
- Statistical inference can be thought of as a game between the statistician, who needs to make a decision about the population, and nature, meaning the relevant features of the population of interest.

---
# Losses vs regrets

- An alternative basis for assessing actions is regret (rather than loss).
The regret function is defined as

`$$r(a, \theta) = l(a, \theta) − min_{a \element A} l(a, \theta) a \in A$$`.

- `\(min l(a, \theta)\)` is the smallest loss for that `\(\theta\)`, so if we `\(a \element A\)`
knew `\(\theta\)` (and took the correct action!) this would be
the loss we'd face
- So `\(r(a, \theta)\)` represents the loss that could have been avoided had the state of nature been known with certainty.
- Using regrets to assess the merits of different consequences rather than losses can lead to a different "optimal" strategy.

# Losses vs regrets

- An alternative basis for assessing actions is regret (rather than loss).
The regret function is defined as

$$r(a, \theta) = l(a, \theta) âˆ’ min_{a \element A} l(a, \theta) a \in A$$.

- $min l(a, \theta)$ is the smallest loss for that $\theta$, so if we $a \element A$
knew $\theta$ (and took the correct action!) this would be
the loss we'd face
- So $r(a, \theta)$ represents the loss that could have been avoided had the state of nature been known with certainty.
- Using regrets to assess the merits of different consequences rather than losses can lead to a different "optimal" strategy.

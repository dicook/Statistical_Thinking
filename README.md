# Statistical Thinking

This repository is housing material for the course ETC2420/ETC5242 Statistical  Thinking using Randomisation and Simulation taught in Spring 2017 in the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics at Monash University.

# Tentative outline

* Topic 1: Simulation of games for decision strategies (2 weeks):

  - Week 1, Class 1.  Case studies in randomization using Australian election. What is randomness? (Include the draw vs flip coin tosses)
  - Week 1, Class 2.  Case studies in randomization (Ch 2, Diez, Barr, Cetinkaya-Rundel). Hypothesis testing I.

  - Lab 1: Introduction to R, functions, permutation, random number generation

  - Week 2, Class 1.  Case studies in randomization (Ch 2, Diez, Barr, Cetinkaya-Rundel). Hypothesis testing II.
  - Week 2, Class 2.  Decision theory. Computing probabilities of outcomes. Zero-sum two-person: adding reward and loss, saddle points, domination. Criteria for making decisions: minimax, Bayes.
